          <h2>Macacque Labs - A non-profit foundation for research in advanced computing</h2>

<p>
Macaque Labs is a non-profit research foundation, founded with the goal of fostering research 
in advanced and applied computing in India. The founder, G S Madhusudan felt that there is a paucity of 
such research in India as evident from the minimal contribution from India in the areas of Computer Architecture, 
Secure System Engineering, Storage Systems and Interconnects. While academic research has progressed to a degree, 
applied research and open source projects 
notably absent.</p>
<p>The foundation is named after the bonnet macaque monkeys at IIT-Madras, whose attitude 
towards life is inspirational to open source projects ! </p>

<p>Current projects being incubated are the Lightstor storage project (see lightstor.org) and 
the Sentinel security Archirtecture project. </p>


<p> LightStor is a unified optical interconnect for storage, networking and compute clusters. It leverages 
silicon photonics and the RapidIO standard. With 25Gbps per lane, per port speeds will approach 400 Gbps,
port aggregation will allow terabit + speeds.</p>

<p>The storage component of LightStor is aimed at SSD arrays and at the lower levels is analogous to 
the NVMExpress standard. But it also aims at providing a complete storage stack including features 
like object storage and HSM. The standard will be completey open. All source and HW design will be
released under the 4.3 BSD 3 part license.</p>

<p>Sentinel is a project aimed at a holistic design of secure computing systems. This requires a 
clean slate design of the operating system, CPU and the systems language. But even in a clean 
slate design, existing paradigms of functional partitioning between these three key components 
do not suffice since these paradigms have evolved in functional silos.</p>

<p>Sentinel aims to establish new paradigms of secure system design using co-design principles 
and validate these paradigms using a test-bed comprising of a capability based micro-kernel 
Operating System and Tagged Instruction Set based CPU architecture. A key supplemental goal 
is to investigate very fine grained security paradigms as opposed to coarse Multics style 
security levels currently prevalent.</p>

<p>Information Flow analysis techniques will also be investigated, as will also language
enhancements required to achieve usable IFA techniques. We also intend to implement an 
access control logic that is capable of performing information flow analysis based on 
the cross-layer information provided by the OS and applications, thereby ensuring 
complete mediation.</p>

<p>The above goals necessarily narrow the design space for CPU architectures. Since 
security at the HW level is proposed to be achieved by Tagged ISA techniques and 
formal verification of the HW is a primary goal, the project will focus on Virtual
cache based CPU architectures with the OS being built around Single Address Space concepts. 
Elimination of an MMU makes formal verification significantly easier.</p>

<p></p>Formal verification will be done using the CoQ system and a variant of Rust will 
be used for language research.
